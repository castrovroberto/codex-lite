## Instructions
Generate the necessary code changes to implement this task. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintain code quality and consistency** with the existing codebase
2. **Follow the project's coding conventions** and patterns
3. **Add appropriate comments and documentation**
4. **Handle errors appropriately**
5. **Write clean, readable, and maintainable code**

## Response Format
Respond with a JSON object containing the changes to be made:

```json
{
  "changes": [
    {
      "action": "create|modify|delete",
      "file_path": "path/to/file.go",
      "content": "full file content for create/modify actions",
      "diff": "unified diff format for modify actions (optional)",
      "reason": "explanation of why this change is needed"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of what was implemented",
  "notes": ["Any important notes or considerations for the developer"],
  "tests_needed": ["Suggestions for tests that should be written"],
  "dependencies": ["Any new dependencies that need to be added"]
}
```

## Important Notes
- For **create** actions, provide the complete file content
- For **modify** actions, provide the complete updated file content
- For **delete** actions, only specify the file_path and action
- Ensure all code compiles and follows best practices
- Consider backward compatibility and existing integrations
- Add appropriate error handling and logging

Generate only valid, working code that can be immediately applied to the project.

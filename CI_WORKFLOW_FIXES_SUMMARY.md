# CI Workflow Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the GitHub Actions CI workflow issues, specifically addressing the deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` and other outdated action versions.

## Root Cause

The primary issue was the use of deprecated GitHub Actions versions:
- **`actions/upload-artifact@v3`** - Scheduled for deprecation on November 30, 2024
- **`actions/cache@v3`** - Outdated version
- **`actions/download-artifact@v3`** - Deprecated version
- **Go version mismatch** in regression workflow

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

#### Updated Actions Versions
- âœ… **`actions/upload-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/upload-artifact@v4`** (6 instances)
  - Test results upload on failure
  - Integration test results upload on failure  
  - Coverage artifacts upload
  - Build artifacts upload
  - Benchmark results upload

- âœ… **`actions/cache@v3` â†’ `actions/cache@v4`** (4 instances)
  - Test job cache
  - Lint job cache
  - Build job cache
  - Benchmark job cache

#### Benefits of v4 Upgrades
- **10x faster uploads** in worst-case scenarios
- **Immediate artifact availability** in UI and REST API
- **Immutable artifacts** preventing corruption
- **Better compression control** with `compression-level` input
- **Enhanced debugging** with artifact outputs (ID, URL, digest)

### 2. Regression Workflow (`.github/workflows/regression.yml`)

#### Updated Actions Versions
- âœ… **`actions/upload-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/upload-artifact@v4`** (3 instances)
  - Regression test artifacts upload
  - Performance benchmark results upload
  - Summary report upload

- âœ… **`actions/download-artifact@v3` â†’ `actions/download-artifact@v4`** (1 instance)
  - Artifact download for summary generation

- âœ… **`actions/cache@v3` â†’ `actions/cache@v4`** (1 instance)
  - Go modules cache

#### Environment Updates
- âœ… **Go version updated** from `1.21` to `1.23` for consistency

### 3. Key Improvements

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Artifact upload on failure** ensures debugging information is preserved
- **Retention policies** properly configured (7-90 days)
- **Matrix-specific naming** prevents artifact conflicts

#### Better Performance
- **Faster uploads/downloads** with v4 architecture
- **Reduced network round trips** with single archive uploads
- **Improved caching** with v4 cache action

#### Enhanced Debugging
- **Artifact outputs** now available (ID, URL, digest)
- **Immediate availability** in GitHub UI
- **Better error messages** and logging

## Compatibility Notes

### Breaking Changes in v4
1. **Cannot upload to same artifact multiple times** - artifacts are now immutable
2. **Matrix jobs require unique names** - use matrix variables in artifact names
3. **500 artifact limit per job** - reasonable limit for most use cases
4. **Hidden files excluded by default** - use `include-hidden-files: true` if needed

### Migration Handled
- âœ… **Matrix artifact naming** already properly implemented with `${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.go-version }}` suffixes
- âœ… **Retention policies** maintained for all artifacts
- âœ… **Conditional uploads** preserved (failure conditions, OS/version specific)

## Verification

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test the updated workflow locally
make ci-test

# Verify artifact uploads work
make test

# Check linting with new versions
make lint
```

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Faster CI runs** due to improved upload/download performance
2. **No more deprecation warnings** in GitHub Actions logs
3. **Immediate artifact availability** for debugging
4. **Better reliability** with immutable artifacts

## Additional Improvements

### .gitignore Updates
Added entries for new artifact types:
```gitignore
# Development and debugging artifacts
debug-output-*
test-results.log
integration-test-results.log
coverage.html
coverage.out
gosec.sarif

# Build artifacts from Makefile
*.html
*.sarif

# golangci-lint cache
.golangci-lint-cache
```

### Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new debugging tools
- Added CI/CD section improvements
- Documented new Makefile targets

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor CI performance** after deployment
2. **Update any custom scripts** that depend on artifact behavior
3. **Consider using artifact outputs** for enhanced workflows
4. **Review retention policies** if storage costs are a concern

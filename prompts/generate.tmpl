## Implementation Instructions
1. **Use function calls for all file operations**:
   - Use `read_file` to examine existing files before modifying them
   - Use `write_file` to create new files or completely rewrite existing ones
   - Use `apply_patch_to_file` for targeted modifications to existing files
   - Use `codebase_search` to understand existing patterns and dependencies
   - Use `list_directory` to explore related code structure

2. **Follow these guidelines**:
   - Read existing files to understand current implementation
   - Maintain code quality and consistency with the existing codebase
   - Follow the project's coding conventions and patterns
   - Add appropriate comments and documentation
   - Handle errors appropriately
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

3. **Safety measures**:
   - Always read files before modifying them
   - Use relative paths from the workspace root
   - Create backups for important modifications (tools handle this automatically)
   - Validate that your changes compile and follows best practices

## Function Calling Workflow
1. **Start by reading relevant existing files** to understand the current state
2. **Search the codebase** for similar patterns or implementations using `codebase_search`
3. **Explore directory structure** if needed to understand project organization
4. **Implement changes** using `write_file` or `apply_patch_to_file`
5. **Validate changes** by reading the modified files if necessary

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Maintain code quality and consistency** with the existing codebase
- **Follow the project's coding conventions** and patterns
- **Add appropriate comments and documentation**
- **Handle errors appropriately**
- **Write clean, readable, and maintainable code**
- **Consider backward compatibility and existing integrations**
- **Add appropriate error handling and logging**

## Safety and Validation
- Always use relative paths from the workspace root
- Read existing files before modifying them to understand current implementation
- Use `apply_patch_to_file` for targeted changes rather than full file rewrites when possible
- Ensure all file operations are within the workspace boundaries
- Handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback

## Final Response
After completing all file operations through function calls, provide a brief summary of:
- What was implemented
- Key decisions made during implementation
- Any important notes for the developer
- Suggested tests that should be written
- Any new dependencies that need to be added
- Any potential issues or considerations

**Important**: Do NOT include file contents in your final response - use function calls instead for all file operations. Your final response should only be a summary of the work completed.

# G304 Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve G304 gosec issues related to "Potential file inclusion via variable" security warnings.

## Root Cause
The G304 issues were caused by using `os.ReadFile()` and `os.Create()` with variable paths that could potentially be manipulated for path traversal attacks. These functions were being called directly with user-controlled or external input without proper path validation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Secure File Operations Package
- **Location**: `internal/security/fileops.go`
- **Purpose**: Provides secure file operations that prevent path traversal attacks
- **Key Features**:
  - Path validation against allowed root directories
  - Automatic path cleaning and resolution
  - Prevention of `../` traversal attacks
  - Support for multiple allowed root directories

### 2. Core Security Functions
- `NewSafeFileOps(allowedRoots ...string)`: Creates a new secure file operations instance
- `ValidatePath(path string)`: Validates that a path is within allowed directories
- `SafeReadFile(path string)`: Secure replacement for `os.ReadFile()`
- `SafeWriteFile(path string, data []byte, perm os.FileMode)`: Secure replacement for `os.WriteFile()`
- `SafeCreate(path string)`: Secure replacement for `os.Create()`
- `SafeRemove(path string)`: Secure file removal
- `SafeStat(path string)`: Secure file stat operations

### 3. Files Fixed

#### cmd/generate.go
- **Lines Fixed**: 118, 166, 295
- **Changes**: 
  - Added safe file operations for reading plan files
  - Secured file reading in task processing
  - Protected backup file operations

#### cmd/review.go
- **Lines Fixed**: 289, 378
- **Changes**:
  - Secured file reading during code analysis
  - Protected backup and fix application operations

#### internal/orchestrator/session_manager.go
- **Lines Fixed**: 124, 287
- **Changes**:
  - Secured session file loading
  - Protected session export operations
  - Added safe file operations to SessionManager struct

#### internal/patchutils/applier.go
- **Lines Fixed**: 289
- **Changes**:
  - Secured backup file reading during rollback operations
  - Added safe file operations to PatchApplier struct

#### internal/textutils/chunker.go
- **Lines Fixed**: 315
- **Changes**:
  - Secured file reading in text chunking operations

#### internal/config/config.go
- **Lines Fixed**: 216
- **Changes**:
  - Secured system prompt file reading
  - Added proper path validation for config-relative files

## Security Benefits

1. **Path Traversal Prevention**: All file operations now validate paths against allowed directories
2. **Input Sanitization**: Paths are cleaned and resolved before validation
3. **Centralized Security**: All secure file operations are handled by a single, well-tested package
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes are transparent to existing code functionality
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All identified G304 issues have been resolved

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite in `internal/security/fileops_test.go`
- Tests cover:
  - Valid path validation
  - Path traversal attack prevention
  - File reading/writing operations
  - Error handling for unauthorized paths

## Verification

All originally reported G304 issues have been resolved:
- ✅ cmd/generate.go:118:15
- ✅ cmd/generate.go:166:22  
- ✅ cmd/generate.go:295:23
- ✅ cmd/review.go:289:27
- ✅ cmd/review.go:378:31
- ✅ internal/orchestrator/session_manager.go:124:15
- ✅ internal/orchestrator/session_manager.go:287:15
- ✅ internal/patchutils/applier.go:289:28
- ✅ internal/textutils/chunker.go:315:18
- ✅ internal/config/config.go:216:21

## Implementation Notes

- The `#nosec G304` comments are used in the secure package after path validation
- Each component creates its own SafeFileOps instance with appropriate allowed roots
- The solution maintains the existing API while adding security underneath
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider using the secure file operations package for any new file operations
2. Regular security audits to identify similar patterns
3. Consider extending the package with additional security features as needed
